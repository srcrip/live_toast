Live Toast is a drop-in replacement for the flash system in Phoenix/LiveView.

## Features

- **📄 Stackable toast messages:** The flash system limits you to one flash per type. No longer!
- **📸 Replaces your flash messages:** One drop in component to continue to render your flash messages in the same style as
    the newer toast system.
- **💅 Beautiful by design:** Based on the look of the wonderful [Sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/) library from React.
- **⚙️ Highly configurable:** Looks good out of the box, but can be changed in pretty much any way you want.
- **🌍 Simple asset delivery:** `LiveToast` simply ships Tailwind classes and lets your project bundle them up. No CSS
    drop-in required.

## Installation

Add `live_toast` to your list of dependencies in the `mix.exs` of your Phoenix
application:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:live_toast, "~> 0.8.0"}
  ]
end
```

Next open up your `app.js` and import/setup the hook.

If you have a `package.json` file at the top of `assets`, you can add this to it:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "live_toast": "file:../deps/live_toast",
},
```

And then import and set up the bare module:

```javascript
import { createLiveToastHook } from 'live_toast'

let liveSocket = new LiveSocket('/live', Socket, {
  hooks: {
    LiveToast: createLiveToastHook()
  }
})
```

Or you can import the file directly:

```javascript
// this path would be relative to where your app.js happens to be.
import { createLiveToastHook } from '../deps/live_toast'

let liveSocket = new LiveSocket('/live', Socket, {
    hooks: {
        LiveToast: createLiveToastHook()
    }
})
```

Then, add `'../deps/live_toast/lib/**/*.*ex'` to your list of paths Tailwind will look for class names, in your
`tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
// assets/tailwind.config.js

module.exports = {
  content: [
    './js/**/*.js',
    '../lib/your_app_web.ex',
    '../lib/your_app_web/**/*.*ex',
    '../deps/live_toast/lib/**/*.*ex',
  ]
}
```

Your particular file will look different but all you need to do is make sure the last line is there.

> **Note for Umbrella Apps:**
> If you're using an umbrella application, your paths above may look different. You'll probably have an extra folder in
> there, so the line you need to add would be more like `"../../../deps/live_toast/lib/**/*.*ex"`

Finally, replace your `<.flash_group />` component with the new `<LiveToast.toast_group />`. It's most likely in your
`app.html.heex`:

```heex
<!-- Remove this! -->
<.flash_group flash={@flash} />

<!-- And replace it with this: -->
<LiveToast.toast_group
  flash={@flash}
  connected={assigns[:socket] != nil}
  toasts_sync={assigns[:toasts_sync]}
/>

<%= @inner_content %>
```

Those three options, `flash`, `connected`, and `toasts_sync` are all required. The library will not function properly if
you do not pass them in.


> **Note:**
> As far as I can tell in my testing, this usage of `assigns` in the layout has no negative impact on change tracking.

And you're done! Note that it's very important to set `connected` based on whether we're in a LiveView or not. This
controls toast/flash display on non-LiveView pages.

## Usage

`LiveToast` will hijack the usual display of your flash messages, so they will continue to work as normal. You can
continue to use flashes as normal, if you want to.

However, one of the reasons to *not* use flash messages, is the Phoenix flash system only allows one message for each
kind of flash. The toast pattern, alternatively, generally allows for multiple messages displayed to the user at at time.

From a LiveView, you can now use [`send_toast`](https://hexdocs.pm/live_toast/LiveToast.html#send_toast/3):

> **Note:**
> Please reference the `Configuration` section below for the available `options`.

```elixir
defmodule YourApp.SomeLiveView do
  def handle_event("submit", _payload, socket) do
    options = [
      title: "Status"
    ]

    # you do some thing with the payload, then you want to show a toast, so:
    LiveToast.send_toast(:info, "Upload successful.", options)

    {:noreply, socket}
  end
end
```

> **Note:**
> `LiveToast` is the top-level module, so there's no need to `alias` or `import` anything.

Or you can use the helper function, [`put_toast`](https://hexdocs.pm/live_toast/LiveToast.html#put_toast/4), similar to how you may use [`put_flash`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Controller.html#put_flash/3):

```elixir
defmodule YourApp.SomeLiveView do
  def handle_event("submit", _payload, socket) do
    socket = socket
    |> LiveToast.put_toast(:info, "Upload successful.")

    {:noreply, socket}
  end
end
```

[`put_toast`](https://hexdocs.pm/live_toast/LiveToast.html#put_toast/4) can take a `Phoenix.LiveView.Socket` or a `Plug.Conn`, so you can use the same thing in your live and
non-live pages.

```elixir
defmodule YourApp.SomeController do
  def create(conn, _params) do
    conn
    |> LiveToast.put_toast(:info, "Upload successful.")
    |> render(:whatever)
  end
end
```

## Configuration

### Setting the corner

You can change which corner the toasts are anchored to by passing the `corner` setting to `toast_group`, one of either `:top_left`, `:top_right`, `:bottom_left`, `:bottom_right`. The default is `:bottom_right`.

```heex
<LiveToast.toast_group
  flash={@flash}
  connected={assigns[:socket] != nil}
  corner={:top_right}
  toasts_sync={assigns[:toasts_sync]}
/>
```

### Internationalization

You can provide translations for the default error toasts by adding the following to your `config.exs`:

```elixir
config :live_toast,
  gettext_backend: MyApp.Gettext
```

Copy the provided template and translations:

```sh
cp -rv deps/live_toast/i18n/gettext/* priv/gettext
# optionally create missing (empty) translation files (.po) based on the template (.pot):
mix gettext.extract --merge
```

You have to provide a `live_toast.po` file, inside the `priv/gettext/<language>/LC_MESSAGES/` folder for each language you want to support.

### Function Options

[`send_toast`](https://hexdocs.pm/live_toast/LiveToast.html#send_toast/3) takes a number of arguments to control it's behavior. They are currently:

- `kind`: The 'level' of this toast. The `component` function can receive this and modify behavior based on severity.
    the `toast_class_fn` also receives it, and it can be used there to modify styles, for example, making `:info` toasts
    green and `:error` toasts red.
- `body`: The primary text of the message.
- `title`: The optional title of the toast displayed at the top.
- `icon`: An optional function component that renders next to the title. You can use this with the default toast to display an icon.
- `action`: An optional function component that renders to the side. You can use this with the default toast to display an action, like a button.
- `component`: Use this to totally override rendering of the toast. This is expected to be a function component that
    will receive all of the above options. See [this part of the demo](https://github.com/srcrip/live_toast/blob/fddcd7c51be05ba9997eb300ca920985e98ab583/demo/lib/demo_web/live/home_live.ex#L61) as an example.

Note that if you use more than just `:info` and `:error` in your codebase for flashes, you can augment LiveToast using
some of the methods below to support that.

### Custom Classes

You can define a [custom toast class function](https://hexdocs.pm/live_toast/LiveToast.html#toast_class_fn/1), like so:

```elixir
defmodule MyModule do
  def toast_class_fn(assigns) do
    [
      # base classes
      "group/toast z-100 pointer-events-auto relative w-full items-center justify-between origin-center overflow-hidden rounded-lg p-4 shadow-lg border col-start-1 col-end-1 row-start-1 row-end-2",
      # start hidden if javascript is enabled
      "[@media(scripting:enabled)]:opacity-0 [@media(scripting:enabled){[data-phx-main]_&}]:opacity-100",
      # used to hide the disconnected flashes
      if(assigns[:rest][:hidden] == true, do: "hidden", else: "flex"),
      # override styles per severity
      assigns[:kind] == :info && "bg-white text-black",
      assigns[:kind] == :error && "!text-red-700 !bg-red-100 border-red-200"
    ]
  end
end

```

And then use it to override the default styles:

```heex
<LiveToast.toast_group
  flash={@flash}
  connected={assigns[:socket] != nil}
  toast_class_fn={&MyModule.toast_class_fn/1}
  toasts_sync={assigns[:toasts_sync]}
/>
```

If you need to change the classes of the container, there is a similar function parameter called [`group_class_fn`](https://hexdocs.pm/live_toast/LiveToast.html#group_class_fn/1). Reference the documentation and apply the override just as you would `toast_class_fn/1` shown above.

### Custom Severity Levels

New Phoenix projects [use `:info` and `:error`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/controllers.html#flash-messages)
as the default severity levels for flash messages, so this is likely what you're already using. If you need to add an
additional severity level, like `:warning`, you can pass a list of these values to the `kind` attribute:

```heex
<LiveToast.toast_group
  flash={@flash}
  connected={assigns[:socket] != nil}
  kinds={[:info, :error, :warning]}
  toast_class_fn={&custom_toast_class_fn/1}
  toasts_sync={assigns[:toasts_sync]}
/>
```

If this value is not set, it defaults to `[:info, :error]`.

Setting `kind` will allow these new severity levels to be displayed, but it won't change how they look. To do that, you
need to override [`toast_class_fn/1`](https://hexdocs.pm/live_toast/LiveToast.html#toast_class_fn/1). For example:

```elixir
# Note that this is just the default with one line added to handle the new `:warning` level.
def custom_toast_class_fn(assigns) do
  [
    # base classes
    "bg-white group/toast z-100 pointer-events-auto relative w-full items-center justify-between origin-center overflow-hidden rounded-lg p-4 shadow-lg border col-start-1 col-end-1 row-start-1 row-end-2",
    # start hidden if javascript is enabled
    "[@media(scripting:enabled)]:opacity-0 [@media(scripting:enabled){[data-phx-main]_&}]:opacity-100",
    # used to hide the disconnected flashes
    if(assigns[:rest][:hidden] == true, do: "hidden", else: "flex"),
    # override styles per severity
    assigns[:kind] == :info && "text-black",
    assigns[:kind] == :error && "!text-red-700 !bg-red-100 border-red-200",
    assigns[:kind] == :warning && "!text-amber-700 !bg-amber-100 border-amber-200"
  ]
end
```

Then just make sure you've passed it to the `live_group` component as seen above.


### JavaScript Options

You can also change some options about the LiveView hook when it is initialized. Such as:

```javascript
import { createLiveToastHook } from 'live_toast'

// the duration for each toast to stay on screen in ms
const duration = 4000

// how many toasts to show on screen at once
const maxItems = 3

const liveToastHook = createLiveToastHook(duration, maxItems)

let liveSocket = new LiveSocket('/live', Socket, {
  hooks: { LiveToast: liveToastHook }
})
```

## Roadmap

Some of the stuff still to work on:

- [ ] A11y
- [ ] Further documentation
- [ ] Even more configuration
- [ ] Lots of amazing tests
- [ ] Spring animations
- [ ] Possibly some way to configure additional severity levels
